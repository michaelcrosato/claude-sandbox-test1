# PROJECT DECISION RECORD

> Status: **DECIDED** (2026-05-22). Supersedes the open question in `docs/GOAL.md`.
> Working name: **Posthorn** (provisional — the human may rename; code paths are kept
> brand-neutral so a rename touches only `package.json`, `README.md`, and this file).

## 1. The decision

Build **Posthorn — open-core reliable webhook-delivery infrastructure.** A service (and
embeddable library) that lets any product send signed, retried, observable webhooks to its
own customers, deployable as a **single container with no external Redis** and a generous
free tier, fully compliant with the **Standard Webhooks** specification.

This is the "send webhooks to your users" category currently owned by **Svix**, with
**Hookdeck Outpost**, **Hook0**, and **Convoy** as the other serious players.

## 2. Why this maximizes the GOAL's two filters

`docs/GOAL.md` sets two filters: *(a) easiest for a fully autonomous coding agent to bring
to production grade*, and *(b) highest profit while improving beyond current offerings.*
Webhook infrastructure is the strongest intersection of the two.

### (a) Easiest to bring to production grade autonomously

The product is **almost entirely deterministic, self-contained logic** — the regime where
an autonomous agent + a test gate is strongest:

| Core capability | Verifiable how |
| --- | --- |
| HMAC signing / verification (Standard Webhooks) | Golden vectors + round-trip unit tests |
| Retry schedule & exponential backoff | Pure-function unit tests |
| Idempotency / dedup keys | Unit tests |
| Delivery state machine, dead-letter, replay | In-process integration tests |
| Subscription & endpoint CRUD | API contract tests against in-process server |
| Fan-out / ordering guarantees | Deterministic integration tests with a fake clock |

No ML nondeterminism, no required third-party accounts, no human design or ops gate to
ship v1. A receiver and sender can both be stood up **in-process** in tests, so every loop
iteration is fully validatable locally — directly serving Axiom 2 (*Keep Main Green*).

### (b) Highest profit + clear improvement over the market

- **Incumbent pricing is steep and ops-heavy.** Svix's free tier (50k msgs) jumps to
  **$490/mo** Professional, then **$100 per million** messages, and self-hosting it needs
  **Postgres + Redis**. Hookdeck Outpost undercuts delivery cost (~$10/M) but is a
  narrower product; Hook0 is SSPL source-available; Convoy (MIT, self-host) is a heavier,
  Redis-backed deployment.
- **The wedge — operational simplicity + price.** Posthorn ships as a **single process,
  SQLite-by-default (Postgres optional), with a durable in-process queue (no Redis)**,
  MIT-licensed, Standard-Webhooks-compliant, with a first-class TS/JS SDK and an
  **embeddable library mode** (use it as a library *or* a standalone gateway). Nobody owns
  the "drop-in, zero-dependency, affordable, spec-compliant" slot for indie/SMB teams.
- **Recurring B2B revenue with classic open-core economics.** Open-source core drives
  adoption; monetize via a hosted cloud (usage-based) and enterprise features (SSO, audit
  log retention, multi-region, SLAs). Micro-SaaS infra margins run 70–85%.

### Target clients

1. **Indie devs / small SaaS teams** priced out of Svix Pro — land via OSS + free hosted tier.
2. **Mid-market platforms** that need to *send* webhooks and currently roll their own badly
   (no retries/signing/observability) — expand via hosted cloud.
3. **Compliance-sensitive / on-prem buyers** who require self-hosting — enterprise license.

### Competition & differentiation summary

| | Svix | Hookdeck Outpost | Hook0 | Convoy | **Posthorn** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| License | source-available | SaaS | SSPL | MIT | **MIT** |
| Self-host deps | PG + Redis | n/a | PG | PG + Redis | **none (SQLite) / PG optional** |
| Library mode | partial | no | no | no | **yes** |
| Standard Webhooks | yes | partial | yes | partial | **yes (first-class)** |
| Entry price | $0 → $490/mo | low | mid | $99/mo | **$0, gentle usage curve** |

## 3. Stack decision (grounded in this sandbox's real toolchain)

Probed available: **Node 24, npm 11, pnpm, Python 3.14, Docker 29** — **no Go**.

- **Language: TypeScript / Node.** Runnable and testable here (so main stays green),
  matches the human's primary ecosystem (their `salesforce-lite-crm` is TS), and the SDKs
  customers consume are TS/JS first. Go's single-static-binary edge is nice but
  unavailable here; Docker presence still delivers the single-container self-host story.
- **HTTP:** Fastify. **Storage:** SQLite default via Node's **built-in `node:sqlite`**
  (revised from `better-sqlite3` — the builtin needs no native compile step and adds zero
  dependencies, strengthening the "single container, no deps" wedge), Postgres optional via a
  thin storage interface. **Queue:** durable, store-backed (no Redis). **Tests:** Vitest.
- **Packaging:** single Docker image; library entrypoint published to npm.

## 4. Roadmap (each phase is one or more validated loop iterations)

- **P0 — Foundation (this iteration):** decision record, TS scaffold, and the spec-compliant
  **signer/verifier** (the security heart) with golden-vector tests. ✅
- **P1 — Delivery core (complete):** retry/backoff schedule ✅, delivery state machine ✅,
  dead-letter ✅ (`src/delivery/`); idempotency/dedup keys ✅, in-memory store + `MessageStore`
  storage interface ✅ (`src/storage/`). All pure/deterministic, heavily tested.
- **P2 — Persistence + queue (complete):** durable, crash-safe SQLite `MessageStore` on
  built-in `node:sqlite` ✅ (`src/storage/sqlite-store.ts`), proven byte-for-byte equivalent to
  the in-memory reference via a shared conformance suite ✅ (`src/storage/conformance.ts`); and the
  reliable-delivery spine — a durable, store-backed **`DeliveryQueue`** ✅ (`src/queue/`) with
  lease-based claiming + visibility timeouts and **crash-safe replay of in-flight work** (a lapsed
  lease is reclaimed, never lost), in both in-memory and SQLite backends held to one shared
  conformance suite. The queue persists delivery *state* (status/attempts/`lastError`) and reuses
  the P1 pure FSM + retry policy for every transition. Deferred to a later tick: a full per-attempt
  audit log (one record per HTTP attempt with response detail) — an observability add-on, distinct
  from the load-bearing state the queue already persists.
- **P2.5 — Delivery worker (complete):** the runtime I/O driver that ties the pieces together —
  `DeliveryWorker` (`src/worker/delivery-worker.ts`) claims due tasks from the queue, loads each
  message from the store, signs it, POSTs it over an **injectable `Transport`** (default
  `fetchTransport`), and settles the task (`complete`/`fail`) so the P1/P2 pure FSM + retry policy
  reschedule a retry or dead-letter an exhausted delivery. Holds **no** retry/state logic of its
  own; it only classifies a 2xx response as success. Every outside-world touch is an injected seam
  (clock, transport, idle `sleep`, and an **`EndpointResolver`** — the exact plug-point where P3's
  endpoint store supplies each task's URL + signing secret). `processOnce()` is the deterministic
  unit of work; `run()`/`stop()` is the continuous poll loop (drains back-to-back, sleeps when idle,
  survives unexpected tick errors via `onError`). A lapsed-and-reclaimed lease surfaces as a
  `StaleLeaseError` on settle, which the worker absorbs (counted `stale`) so it never double-settles.
  Per-attempt HTTP timeout via `AbortSignal`. Proven end-to-end: a worker-emitted request **verifies
  against the existing verifier** in tests and a compiled-`dist` smoke run. v1 processes a claimed
  batch sequentially (bounded concurrency is the next throughput optimization).
- **P3 — endpoints + HTTP API + SDK (in progress):**
  - **Endpoint store ✅ (this tick):** the persisted subscription/endpoint entity the rest of P3
    sits on. `Endpoint` (tenant-scoped via `appId`; url + signing secret + event-type subscription
    filter + disabled flag), the `EndpointStore` CRUD contract (`create`/`get`/`listByApp`/
    `update`/`delete`), shared pure validation/normalization (http(s)-only URL, deduped filter,
    injectable secret generation), in-memory reference + durable SQLite backends on one shared
    conformance suite (`src/endpoints/`) — the exact `MessageStore`/`DeliveryQueue` pattern. Wired
    to the worker: a queued `DeliveryTask` now carries an opaque `endpointId`, and
    `storeBackedResolver` fills the worker's `EndpointResolver` seam — proven end-to-end (a stored
    endpoint's secret signs a delivery that verifies against the verifier, in tests and a compiled-
    `dist` smoke run). The worker is no longer an island awaiting a hand-written resolver.
  - **Message fan-out ✅ (this tick):** the step that makes the parts a *service* — `src/fanout/`.
    A message is now **tenant-aware** (`appId` added to `Message`/`NewMessage`), and because the
    message carries a tenant, **idempotency is now scoped per app** (`getByIdempotencyKey(appId, key)`,
    composite `(app_id, key)` SQLite PK, nested in-memory index) — one tenant's key can no longer
    dedup against *or leak* another tenant's message (a real cross-tenant bug that adding `appId`
    would otherwise have introduced). `selectFanoutTargets` is the **pure** routing rule (enabled +
    `endpointSubscribesTo`, with skip-reason buckets for observability); `fanOut` lists a message's
    `appId` endpoints, selects, and enqueues one `DeliveryTask` per match (carrying the opaque
    `endpointId`); `ingest` accepts a message and fans it out in one call, **suppressing re-fan-out
    on a deduplicated retry** (the headline `POST /messages` operation). Proven end-to-end through
    the compiled `dist` (ingest → fan-out → queue → worker → sign → **verify**) including cross-tenant
    idempotency isolation. **Honest limitation:** `ingest`'s create+fan-out is not one atomic unit —
    a crash between them leaves a message whose retry dedups and skips fan-out; the robust fix is a
    transactional outbox (enqueue inside the create txn), deferred.
  - **App/tenant entity + API-key auth ✅ (this tick):** the identity layer that turns `appId`
    from a forgeable opaque string into an authenticated tenant — `src/apps/`. `App`
    (`id`/`name`/timestamps) is the tenant a single instance serves; each app owns one or more
    `ApiKey`s. The `AppStore` contract adds app CRUD (`create`/`get`/`list`/`update`/`delete`) plus
    the credential surface (`createApiKey`/`listApiKeys`/`revokeApiKey`/`authenticate`).
    **Security model:** a key secret is 256 bits of CSPRNG output, so the store keeps only
    `sha256(secret)` (hex) — which doubles as the O(1) `authenticate` lookup index — and returns the
    plaintext exactly once at creation (never recoverable); a deliberately fast hash, not a password
    KDF, because the input is high-entropy (the same reasoning behind storing the P0 signer's
    secrets). Constant-time hash compare on the auth path (defense-in-depth atop the indexed match);
    revoked keys never re-authenticate; `authenticate` is a pure read (no hot-path write). Same proven
    dual-backend + one-shared-conformance-suite pattern (in-memory reference + durable SQLite; the
    SQLite backend ties keys to apps with `ON DELETE CASCADE` so deleting a tenant reaps its keys
    atomically). A golden SHA-256 vector pins the on-disk hash format so a future change can't silently
    invalidate every stored key. Proven end-to-end on the compiled `dist` (mint → authenticate →
    revoke-denies → cross-tenant isolation → cascade-delete-denies). This is the exact plug-point the
    HTTP API's auth middleware will call: `authenticate(presentedKey)` → `appId` → scope the existing
    endpoint/message/ingest operations. **Deferred within auth:** per-key `lastUsedAt` (kept off the
    hot read path as an observability add-on).
  - **HTTP API ✅ (this tick):** the layer that turns the engine into a *runnable service* —
    `src/http/`. Built on Node's **built-in `node:http`** (revised from the long-deferred Fastify:
    the builtin needs no `npm install`/network access in this sandbox and adds **zero runtime
    dependencies**, the same reasoning that chose `node:sqlite`/`node:crypto` — and *strengthens* the
    single-container, zero-dep wedge rather than compromising it with a framework). Mirrors the
    delivery worker's pure-core/thin-I/O split: a **pure router** (`router.ts`, `matchRoute` →
    matched/methodNotAllowed/notFound) + a **pure request→response handler** (`api.ts`,
    `createApi(deps)`) composing `AppStore.authenticate` (Bearer auth), `EndpointStore` (CRUD), and
    `ingest` (accept + fan-out), behind a thin `node:http` adapter (`server.ts`, `createHttpServer`)
    that only reads the body (1 MiB cap → `413`), normalizes the request, and writes JSON. Surface:
    unauthenticated `GET /healthz`; authenticated `POST /v1/messages` (`202`), `GET/POST /v1/endpoints`,
    `GET/PATCH/DELETE /v1/endpoints/:id`. **Security decisions (not incidental):** tenancy is taken
    from the authenticated key, never a request-body `appId` (no tenant forgery); cross-tenant access
    is `404` not `403` (existence never revealed); an endpoint's signing secret is returned exactly
    once on create and never echoed by list/get/update; app/key *provisioning* is deliberately **not**
    an HTTP route (a privileged bootstrap with no key to authenticate it — it stays on the programmatic
    `AppStore`; an admin/control-plane route is a later tick). Proven end-to-end on the compiled `dist`
    over a real socket (auth → endpoint create → ingest → worker drains → the signed delivery
    **verifies** against the endpoint secret), plus a pure in-process suite (router + handler + a
    `node:http` integration test on an ephemeral port).
  - **Runnable gateway ✅ (this tick):** the composition root that makes the standalone-gateway
    half of the wedge real — `src/runtime/` + `src/main.ts`. The HTTP API had only landed as a
    `createHttpServer(deps)` *factory*; nothing instantiated the durable stores, joined them, opened
    a socket, and started the worker, so Posthorn could be *constructed* in a test but not *run*.
    `loadConfig(env)` is a **pure**, exhaustively-tested env→`GatewayConfig` parser (`POSTHORN_*`
    vars, validated, frozen; no `process.env`/socket/fs access — the same pure-core discipline as the
    HTTP handler). `createGateway(config)` is pure plumbing: it opens the four SQLite backends under
    `dataDir` (one file per store, or `:memory:`), wires `ingest` + the worker (`storeBackedResolver`)
    + the HTTP server, and returns a `Gateway` with `start()` (listen + run the worker; returns the
    bound address) and an idempotent, graceful `stop()` (drain the worker, close the server's idle
    sockets, release every SQLite handle). `src/main.ts` is the thin `posthorn` bin (shebang +
    `npm start`): load config, boot, translate `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` into `stop()`. The stores are
    exposed on the `Gateway` so the keyless app/key bootstrap stays programmatic (still no HTTP
    route). Proven end-to-end on the **compiled `dist`**: the binary boots and serves `/healthz` over
    a real socket, and a full provision→ingest→deliver→**verify** round-trip runs through the built
    ESM (incl. the `node:sqlite` `createRequire` path); an in-process suite adds durability across a
    restart (an endpoint created before `stop()` survives a fresh `createGateway`).
  - **Transactional outbox ✅ (this tick):** the fix that closes the one known correctness gap in
    the core path — `src/fanout/fanout-dispatcher.ts` + outbox state in the message store. Accepting
    a message and recording that it *owes a fan-out* is now a single atomic step in the store (a
    `fanned_out_at` marker, written in the same transaction that inserts the message — exposed as
    `CreateMessageResult.fanoutPending` + `MessageStore.markFannedOut`/`listPendingFanout`). So the
    old window — message stored, but its idempotent retry dedups and *skips* fan-out, stranding
    deliveries — is gone: the marker survives a crash. It is drained two ways: (1) a producer's retry
    sees `fanoutPending` and re-drives the owed fan-out (`ingest`); (2) a **`FanoutDispatcher`** (the
    structural twin of the delivery worker — `sweepOnce`/`run`/`stop`, fully fake-clock-testable)
    sweeps any message left pending past a grace period, the path for fire-and-forget producers that
    never retry. The dispatcher reuses the pure `fanOut`, so routing can't drift; it is wired into the
    gateway and runs alongside the worker. A SQLite **migration** brings a pre-outbox database up to
    schema, backfilling existing rows as already-fanned-out so an upgrade never re-delivers history.
    **Net guarantee:** end-to-end delivery is now *at-least-once* (the residual being a possible
    duplicate if a crash strikes between the queue enqueue and the cross-store marker-clear — the
    queue's existing at-least-once contract, covered by receiver-side dedup on the stable message id);
    the previous gap allowed *zero*-once. Proven through the compiled `dist` (orphan → dispatcher
    sweep → worker → **verify**) and a running-gateway end-to-end test.
  - **Admin provisioning CLI ✅ (this tick):** the **bootstrap path** that makes a deployed gateway
    actually usable — `src/runtime/admin.ts` + an `admin` dispatch in `src/main.ts`. The HTTP API
    authenticates every route with a Bearer key, but minting the *first* key has no HTTP route (no key
    exists yet to authenticate the call, and an open provisioning endpoint is the door we refuse to
    build). Before this tick that left provisioning reachable *only* programmatically against
    `AppStore` — so a freshly-booted `posthorn` could be started but had **no way to create a
    credential against it**, leaving the entire authenticated API unreachable out of the box. The CLI
    closes that gap behind the correct privilege boundary — **the shell on the host that owns the data
    directory**, not the network. `posthorn admin <command>`: `create-app [name]`, `create-key
    <appId>` (prints the one-time secret), `list-apps`, `list-keys <appId>`, `revoke-key <keyId>`,
    `help`. Faithful to the pure-core/thin-I/O split: `runAdminCommand(args, {store, out, err})` is the
    tested core (injected store + output sinks, returns a process exit code, no I/O of its own — 22
    unit tests over an `InMemoryAppStore`), and `main.ts` is the thin shell that opens the
    `SqliteAppStore` at the *same* location the gateway uses (a now-shared `resolveLocations`, so admin
    and server can never disagree on the file). WAL makes it safe against a live gateway. Proven on the
    compiled `dist` across processes: provision via the CLI, then a separately-spawned server
    authenticates the minted key over real HTTP (401 without → 200 with), a CLI `revoke-key` is
    honored by the running server (→ 401), and `list-keys` never echoes the full secret.
  - **Delivery-status read API ✅ (this tick):** the *observable* half of the product's
    one-line promise ("signed, retried, **observable** webhooks"), which until now had no surface at
    all — a producer could `POST /v1/messages`, get a `202`, and then never learn the fate of the
    delivery. `GET /v1/messages/:id` (`src/http/api.ts`) returns the message plus **one delivery
    record per subscribed endpoint** — `status` (pending/delivering/succeeded/dead_letter), `attempts`,
    `nextAttemptAt`, and `lastError` — answering "what happened to my webhook?", the single
    most-used feature of every incumbent (Svix/Convoy's dashboards). The load-bearing addition is a new
    **`DeliveryQueue.listByMessage(messageId)`** read primitive (the queue already persisted per-task
    `status`/`attempts`/`lastError`; nothing exposed it per message): added to the contract, both
    backends (in-memory filter; SQLite `WHERE message_id` + a new `idx_delivery_tasks_message`,
    auto-created via `IF NOT EXISTS` so an existing DB needs no migration — it is a pure read
    optimization), and the one shared conformance suite (3 cases × 2 backends). **Security:** tenancy
    from the key; a message belonging to another app (or absent) is `404`, never revealed — identical
    to the endpoint routes. Internal queue plumbing (`leaseToken`) is omitted from the view. Proven by
    a deterministic unit path (ingest → `worker.processOnce` → status flips `pending`→`succeeded`), a
    real-socket gateway end-to-end, and a compiled-`dist` SQLite smoke run.
  - **TypeScript/JavaScript SDK ✅ (this tick):** the headline DX differentiator from the wedge —
    `src/sdk/`. A *consumer* now imports a typed client instead of hand-rolling `fetch`, header
    construction, and error parsing. `PosthornClient({ baseUrl, apiKey })` covers the full v1 surface
    (`health`/`sendMessage`/`getMessage`/`listEndpoints`/`createEndpoint`/`getEndpoint`/
    `updateEndpoint`/`deleteEndpoint`); a non-2xx becomes a `PosthornApiError` carrying the HTTP
    `status` + the envelope's machine `code` (falling back to `http_<status>`), a transport failure a
    `PosthornError`, and a request past `timeoutMs` a `PosthornTimeoutError` (via an `AbortController`).
    The wire types are **SDK-owned views**, not the server's domain types, because the HTTP surface
    returns deliberately reduced shapes (an endpoint's `secret` is write-only; a delivery's internal
    `leaseToken` is never exposed) — the SDK models exactly what crosses the wire. **Zero runtime
    dependencies:** it speaks over the platform `fetch`, injectable for tests/exotic runtimes. It also
    ships the **receiver** half so a consumer's whole integration is one import: `verifyWebhook(secret,
    headers, rawBody)` / `isValidWebhook(...)` (`src/sdk/verify.ts`) extract the three Standard Webhooks
    headers from a raw header bag (case-insensitive, array-tolerant) and delegate to the proven library
    `verify` — no crypto duplicated, so the two can't drift. Proven by a pure receiver-verify suite, an
    in-process client suite against the real `node:http` server (CRUD, idempotency, secret-never-leaked,
    401/404 mapping, injected-fetch error/timeout/parse paths), and a **full end-to-end test driven
    entirely through the SDK** (send → running worker delivers → the receiver verifies with the SDK's
    own `verifyWebhook` → the SDK's `getMessage` observes `succeeded`), plus a compiled-`dist` smoke run
    of that same loop through production ESM.
  - **Message listing — `GET /v1/messages` ✅ (this tick):** the *collection* half of the product's
    observability promise, completing the single-message read from the prior tick. A producer can now
    enumerate what it has sent — newest-first — rather than only fetching a message whose id it already
    kept; this is the load-bearing surface every incumbent's dashboard is built on, and a prerequisite
    for the eventual hosted control plane (P5). **Keyset-paginated, not offset-paginated** (`src/storage/
    message-store.ts`): a new `MessageStore.listByApp(appId, {limit, cursor})` orders by `(createdAt,
    id)` descending and pages on an opaque cursor encoding the last row's `(createdAt, id)` — stable
    under concurrent inserts (a new message lands on page one, never shifting an in-flight scan) and an
    indexed lookup as the unbounded log grows. One shared ordering rule (`compareMessagesNewestFirst` /
    `isMessageAfterCursor`) is mirrored by the in-memory sort and the SQLite `ORDER BY … DESC` + keyset
    predicate, so the two backends can't drift; both pass the same expanded conformance suite (9 new
    cases × 2 backends — empty, newest-first, tenant-scoping, multi-page coverage, exact-multiple
    termination, same-ms id tiebreak, limit cap, malformed-cursor reject). SQLite gains
    `idx_messages_app_created (app_id, created_at, id)`, created via `IF NOT EXISTS` so an existing DB
    needs **no migration** (a pure read optimization, like the prior tick's per-message index). The HTTP
    layer learned to parse a **query string** (`ApiRequest.query`, filled by the `node:http` adapter) —
    the reusable `?limit=&cursor=` rail every future list/filter route needs; the route validates
    `?limit=` to a 400 and scopes to the authenticated tenant (a listing never reveals another tenant's
    messages). **Lean list rows** (`messageListItemView`): id/appId/eventType/idempotencyKey/createdAt
    only — no payload, no per-endpoint deliveries, so a page never fans out into an N+1 delivery query;
    the detail (`GET /v1/messages/:id`) carries those. The SDK gained `client.listMessages({limit,
    cursor})` → `{ data: MessageRef[], nextCursor }`. Proven by the expanded conformance suite, a pure
    handler suite (auth/empty/order/paging/400s/tenant-isolation), a real-socket query-parsing test, an
    in-process SDK paging test, and a compiled-`dist` smoke run (send 5 → page through 3× via the SDK →
    full list lean + `nextCursor:null`).
  - **Manual retry / replay — `POST /v1/messages/:id/retry` ✅ (this tick):** the operator's
    recovery path, and the last unaddressed word in the tagline ("signed, **retried**, observable").
    Automatic retries (the P1 policy + FSM) absorb transient receiver blips, but a *sustained* outage
    exhausts the schedule and the delivery lands in the terminal `dead_letter` state — which until now
    was a permanent dead end: once a receiver was fixed, nothing could make Posthorn try again. Every
    incumbent (Svix/Convoy/Hookdeck) exposes exactly this as "replay"/"retry". Built faithful to the
    pure-core discipline: a new **`manualRetry`** event on the delivery FSM (`src/delivery/delivery-state.ts`)
    — the *only* transition out of a terminal state — revives a finished delivery as a brand-new one
    (`pending`, deliverable now, **attempt budget reset** so the full schedule applies again — keeping
    the exhausted count would re-dead-letter on the first new attempt — and `lastError` cleared).
    The queue gains a pure `applyManualRetry` helper (defers to the reducer, so terminal→pending can't
    drift) and a **`DeliveryQueue.retry(taskId)`** primitive (both backends, +4 shared conformance cases
    × 2: revives dead_letter→claimable with budget reset, revives succeeded, `UnknownDeliveryTaskError`
    on unknown id, `DeliveryStateError` on a non-terminal task). A thin **`retryMessageDeliveries`**
    orchestration (`src/queue/retry-message.ts`, the structural twin of `fanOut`) lists a message's
    tasks and re-drives only the **dead-lettered** ones — succeeded/in-flight/pending are left untouched
    (replaying healthy deliveries is not what "retry the failures" means) — absorbing the concurrent
    double-retry race (`DeliveryStateError` ⇒ "already revived", like a lapsed lease). The route is
    tenant-scoped (another tenant's/absent message is `404`, never revealed, identical to the read
    route), returns the refreshed per-endpoint statuses, and the SDK gains `client.retryMessage(id)`.
    Proven by FSM unit tests, the expanded conformance suite, a service suite incl. a **worker-driven
    full recovery loop** (ingest → dead_letter → retry → delivered), pure handler + SDK tests, and a
    compiled-`dist` SQLite smoke (dead_letter → retry → delivered+**verified** through production ESM).
    Net: a dead-lettered delivery is recoverable instead of lost — `dead_letter` is no longer terminal
    for an operator.
  - **Deferred (next ticks):** an **OpenAPI** spec over this surface (the SDK now covers typed TS
    consumers; OpenAPI would serve other-language clients + interactive docs); an admin/control-plane
    *HTTP* route for app/key provisioning (the CLI now covers local bootstrap); a full per-attempt audit
    log (one record per HTTP attempt with response detail — richer than the current
    latest-state-per-endpoint view); and per-key `lastUsedAt`.
- **P4 — Self-host packaging:** config ✅ (env-driven `loadConfig`) + a runnable single-process
  entrypoint ✅ (`posthorn` bin / `npm start`) + a `/healthz` liveness probe ✅ + an **admin
  provisioning CLI** ✅ (`posthorn admin …`, see P3) + a **single-container `Dockerfile`** ✅ (this
  tick) — so a deployed instance can be bootstrapped without writing code.
  - **Single-container image ✅ (this tick):** the headline deployment artifact that makes the
    "single container, no Redis" wedge a *thing you can `docker run`*, not just a prose claim. A
    multi-stage `Dockerfile` (+ `.dockerignore`): stage 1 (`node:24-alpine`) `npm ci` + `tsc` →
    `dist/` and strips the compiled `*.test.*` output; stage 2 copies **only** `dist/` + the
    `package.json` that marks the output ESM (`"type":"module"`) onto a bare Node base — **no
    `node_modules`, because the runtime has zero dependencies** (every moving part is a `node:*`
    built-in), the cleanest possible expression of the wedge. Runs as the unprivileged `node` user,
    persists durable SQLite state to a `/data` `VOLUME`, sets `POSTHORN_*` defaults, and ships a
    dependency-free `HEALTHCHECK` (Node's built-in `fetch` against `/healthz`). One exec-form
    `ENTRYPOINT ["node","dist/main.js"]` serves the gateway with no args (PID-1 `node` receives
    `SIGTERM` → the existing graceful drain) **and** runs the one-shot `posthorn admin <command>`
    bootstrap with args — so the same image provisions the first key and runs the server. **Validated
    for real, beyond the standard gate:** `docker build` succeeds; the booted container serves
    `/healthz` (Docker reports `healthy`); the `admin` CLI mints an app+key in a *separate* container
    sharing the `/data` volume and the running server **authenticates that key over HTTP** (401
    without → 200/202 with); a sent message is listable; `docker stop` drains gracefully; and the
    message **survives a full container teardown + fresh boot** on the same volume (durability, no
    Redis). Image ~231 MB (Alpine + Node). Remaining in P4: a metrics endpoint and operator docs.
- **P5 — Hosted control plane:** multi-tenant, usage metering, billing, dashboard (monetization).

## 5. Out of scope / non-goals

- Not a CRM (the human already builds `salesforce-lite-crm`) and unrelated to `AC1`/`agy-sandbox`.
- v1 does not aim to *receive/ingest* third-party webhooks (Hookdeck's lane); focus is
  reliable **sending**. Ingestion is a possible later expansion.
