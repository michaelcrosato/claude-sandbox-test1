# Posthorn

> Open-core, [Standard Webhooks](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/)-compliant **reliable
> webhook delivery infrastructure**. Single container, **no Redis**, MIT-licensed.
>
> _Working name — see [`docs/PROJECT.md`](docs/PROJECT.md) for the full product decision._

Posthorn lets any product send **signed, retried, observable** webhooks to its own
customers, with the operational simplicity that the incumbents (Svix, Convoy) lack: it runs
as a single process backed by SQLite by default (Postgres optional), with a durable queue
built in — no separate Redis to operate.

## Status

Early foundation. Implemented so far:

- ✅ **Standard Webhooks signer / verifier** — HMAC-SHA256, `whsec_` secrets, `v1,` signature
  scheme, replay-window enforcement, key-rotation (multi-signature) support. Verified against
  the canonical Standard Webhooks test vector.

See the roadmap in [`docs/PROJECT.md`](docs/PROJECT.md).

## Quickstart (signing module)

```ts
import { sign, verify, generateSecret } from "posthorn";

const secret = generateSecret(); // "whsec_..."
const id = "msg_2k1...";
const timestamp = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
const payload = JSON.stringify({ event: "user.created", id: 42 });

// Sender side — produce the `webhook-signature` header value:
const signature = sign(secret, { id, timestamp, payload });

// Receiver side — throws WebhookVerificationError on any mismatch / replay:
verify(secret, { id, timestamp, signature }, payload);
```

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test         # vitest
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```
